If you want to installing Thonny into default folder (/opt/thonny), 
execute `install` with admin privileges. For example in Ubuntu execute

> sudo ./install

If you want to choose the parent directory for Thonny, then give it as 
argument to `install`, eg.

> ./install ~/my_programs

Installer will create a subdirectory named "thonny" in given directory,
and copies Thonny files there.

If Thonny gets installed under /home, then start menu item will be 
created for current user only. Otherwise start menu item for all users 
will be created.
