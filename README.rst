Thonny
======

Thonny is a Python IDE meant for learning programming.

Features:

* Statement stepping without breakpoints
* Live variables during debugging
* Stepping through evaluation of the expressions (expressions get replaced by their values)
* Separate windows for executing function calls (helps explaining local variables and call stack; good understanding of how function calls work is especially important for understanding recursion)  
* Variables can be explained either by using simplified model (name -> value) or by using more realistic model (name -> address/id -> value)
