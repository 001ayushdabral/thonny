!!! News !!!
18th of August: The repo is converted to git

!!! Note for paper reviewer !!!
===============================
Current installers provide Thonny version where "Step into" and "Step over" are merged into single command "Step". These installers (0.2.7) are recommended for reviewing main features of Thonny.

Code for latest features will appear on 23rd of August (was 16th, sorry).

Thonny
======

Thonny is a Python IDE meant for learning programming.

Features:

* Statement stepping without breakpoints
* Live variables during debugging
* Stepping through evaluation of the expressions (expressions get replaced by their values)
* Separate windows for executing function calls (helps explaining local variables and call stack; good understanding of how function calls work is especially important for understanding recursion)  
* Variables can be explained either by using simplified model (name -> value) or by using more realistic model (name -> address/id -> value)
